<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark 4.6.0 included the following changes.
See the
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-4.6.0.html">release notes</a>
for details:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark can dissect process information, packet metadata, flow IDs, drop information, and other information provided by <code>tcpdump</code> on macOS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now ship universal macOS installers instead of separate packages for Arm64 and Intel. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/17294">Issue 17294</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WinPcap is no longer supported. On Windows, use Npcap instead, uninstalling WinPcap if necessary.
The final release of WinPcap was version 4.1.3 in 2013.
It only supports up to Windows 8, which is no longer supported by Microsoft or Wireshark.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new “Plots” dialog has been added, which provides scatter plots in contrast to the “I/O Graphs” dialog, which provides histograms.
The Plots dialog window supports multiple plots, markers, and automatic scrolling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Live captures can be compressed while writing. (Previously there was
support for compressing when performing multiple file capture, at file
rotation time.) The <code>--compress</code> option in TShark works on live captures
as well. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/9311">Issue 9311</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark can now decrypt NTP packets using NTS (Network Time Security). To decrypt packets,
the NTS-KE (Network Time Security Key Establishment Protocol) packets need to be present,
alongside the TLS client and exporter secrets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark’s ability to decrypt MACsec packets has been expanded to either
use the SAK unwrapped by the MKA dissector, or the PSK configured in the
MACsec dissector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TCP Stream Graph axes now use units with SI prefixes. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20197">Issue 20197</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display filter functions <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> are added to allow explicitly
converting field types like integers and times to single and double precision
floats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <span class="menuseq"><b class="menu">Edit</b>&#160;<b class="caret">&#8250;</b> <b class="submenu">Copy</b>&#160;<b class="caret">&#8250;</b> <b class="menuitem">as HTML</b></span> menu item has been added, along with associated context menu items and a keyboard shortcut.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Conversations and Endpoints dialogs have an option to display byte counts and bit rates in exact counts instead of human-readable numbers with SI units.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The color scheme can be set to Light or Dark mode independently of the current OS default on Windows and macOS, if Wireshark is built with Qt 6.8 or later as the official installers are. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/19328">Issue 19328</a></p>
